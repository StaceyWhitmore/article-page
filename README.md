### README.md article-page

This is a simplified repository for the previous repo under
'front-end-project-project', which was built on Next.js. This build does not use
Next.js and and I have removed many of the the unnecessary modules for better
readability. Also, for better readability I have split the aforementioned
project into two separate modules and repos: article-page (this repo) and
tile-page (for the other half of the project.)

Here is an excerpt of the markdown outlining the details.

### Project Tasks
* In the comps folder are two outlines to code up--Article (this one)
and Tile (contained in the other repo as tile-page).
* Details are included in the spec sheet.
